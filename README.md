# PROJECT TITLE:

 Satellite Based Crop-Health-Estimation

 # PROBLEM STATEMENT:
 
How can we provide farmers with a low-cost,scalable 
tool to monitor crop health and predict yields
without installing any physical hardware in their fields?"

# SOLUTION
We are building a low-cost, accessible website     that eliminates
the need for physical hardware.
How it Works: Users simply select a location and date range
to receive a detailed crop health analysis.
SLIDE 4
The Innovation: Leveraging freely available satellite data and
powerful cloud computing (Sentinel Hub API) to deliver 
insights that were previously only available to large agricultural 
corporations with advanced technology
